## What this website is
Clipzy is a website for streamers to **collect, manage, and export stream clips**. Today it ships as a clean waitlist landing page targeting **Twitch** creators (Kick support coming soon) with a builtâ€‘in preview of the app and a minimal form to capture **name + email**. This codebase is intended to grow into the full Clipzy marketing site and docs hub as features roll out on **iOS**, **Android**, and **macOS**.

## How to deploy to Vercel

2) Import the repo in Vercel and select the framework preset it detects (e.g., React/Vite or Next.js).
3) Set the build & output (usually `npm run build` and `dist/` for Vite).
4) Click **Deploy**. Vercel will build on every push to `main`.
